# MinimalAPI

With the arrival of **.NET 6**, Microsoft made available the Minimal APIs feature, which were designed to allow the creation of HTTP APIs that use fewer resources, being a great implementation of microservices and applications that consume the minimum of dependencies from **ASP .NET Core**

## Project

The Project consists of creating a **Minimal API** with **.NET 6**, with the sole purpose of studying its concept and practice.
Using as few dependencies as possible to create a simple **CRUD** with **Swagger** and using **Entity Framework 7** (pre-release)
